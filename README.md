# Darwin World: An Evolution Simulation

## Overview

**Darwin World** is a simulation game that emulates the evolution of species within a dynamically changing ecosystem. Inspired by the works in "Land of Lisp" by Conrad Barski, an article in "Scientific American", and "Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning" by David E. Goldberg.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Ecosystem**: A grid-based world where animals search for food, reproduce, and evolve.
- **Animal Characteristics**: Each animal has specific traits, including energy levels that dictate their ability to survive, reproduce, and navigate the world.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Utilize genetic algorithms for species evolution, including mutation and inheritance of traits.
- **Real-time Evolution Observation**: Allows users to witness the natural selection process as species adapt and evolve over time.
- **Different simulation variants**: You can add 2 simulation variants: Back and Forth, Tides and Ebb.
